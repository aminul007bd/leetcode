Walkthrough Example:
Letâ€™s walk through the code with the following binary tree:

         3
        / \
       9  20
       /   \
      15   7

Level 0:
The root node (3) is added to the queue.
The queue contains: [3].
qlen = 1, because there is 1 node at this level.
row = 0.
The node 3 is dequeued, and its value is added to row, so row = 3.
The left child (9) and right child (20) of node 3 are enqueued.
The queue now contains: [9, 20].
The average for this level is 3 / 1 = 3.0, so ans = [3.0].

Level 1:
The queue contains: [9, 20].
qlen = 2, because there are 2 nodes at this level.
row = 0.
The node 9 is dequeued, and its value is added to row, so row = 9.
The node 20 is dequeued, and its value is added to row, so row = 29.
The left child (15) and right child (7) of node 20 are enqueued.
The queue now contains: [15, 7].
The average for this level is 29 / 2 = 14.5, so ans = [3.0, 14.5].
Level 2:

The queue contains: [15, 7].
qlen = 2, because there are 2 nodes at this level.
        row = 0.
The node 15 is dequeued, and its value is added to row, so row = 15.
The node 7 is dequeued, and its value is added to row, so row = 22.
The queue is now empty.
The average for this level is 22 / 2 = 11.0, so ans = [3.0, 14.5, 11.0].
Final Output:

The tree traversal is complete, and the list of averages for each level is [3.0, 14.5, 11.0].
Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
Space Complexity:
O(m), where m is the maximum number of nodes at any level (which is the maximum width of the tree).
This space is required for the queue used in level-order traversal.*/
