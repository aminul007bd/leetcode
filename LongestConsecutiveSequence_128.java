    //Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the
    // longest consecutive elements sequence.
    //You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
    //Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    //Output: 4
    //Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is
    // [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

    // O(nlgn)
    // Space O(n)

    /*Example:
    Letâ€™s say num = 1, and numSet = {1, 2, 3, 4, 100, 200}.

            First check:
    num + length = 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 is in the set, we increment length to 2.
    Second check:
    num + length = 1 + 2 = 3. Since 3 is in the set, we increment length to 3.
    Third check:
    num + length = 1 + 3 = 4. Since 4 is in the set, we increment length to 4.
    Fourth check:
    num + length = 1 + 4 = 5. Since 5 is not in the set, the loop breaks, and the final length of the sequence is 4.
    In this case, the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4] has a length of 4.*/
